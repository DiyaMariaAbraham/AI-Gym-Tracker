# Exercise Form Corrector using Pose Estimation

This repository contains a Python script that uses the `mediapipe` library along with `opencv` and `streamlit` to provide real-time feedback on the form of various exercises based on body posture detected from a video input.

## Features

- Provides feedback on the form of four different exercises: Push Ups, Squats, Lat Raises, and Bicep Curls.
- Uses Pose Estimation to track key points on the body and calculates angles to assess exercise form.
- Counts the number of correctly performed exercises and provides corrective messages.
- Interactive user interface built with Streamlit for easy usage and visualization.

## Setup and Usage
